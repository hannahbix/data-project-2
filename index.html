				<p>“The Northern Triangle” is a name primarily used by the U.S. government to reference three Central American countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. As the Council on Foreign Relations notes, the U.S. government takes a particular interest in these three countries because of their proximity and high rates of immigration to the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

				<h3>Show me the data</h3>

				<p>Recently, and after a push from watchdog and advocacy organizations like the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN), the U.S. government consolidated its foreign assistance funding onto a single website, ForeignAssistance.gov. With this consolidation, more accurate, timely, and consolidated data is available to analyze U.S. foreign assistance around the world. </p>

				<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>

				<p> In the broader $3.23 trillion dollar U.S. foreign assistance portfolio (over the past 19 years), the Northern Triangle is a small but significant piece of the puzzle. Data from 2001-2020 shows that the three countries combined rank 23rd (with $22.86 billion in funding) for countries that receive the most assistance. Countries that top the list, such as Afghanistan, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, South Africa, and Kenya, tend to represent essential economic or strategic alliances. Thus, the Northern Triangle is noteworthy because the main interest for the U.S. is stemming the flow of migration and maintaining regional stability.</p>

			<h3> Key Takeaway #1: Funding fluctuates from year to year </h3>

			<p>U.S. foreign assistance funding to the region fluctuates significantly from year to year. This illustrates the politicized nature of funding to the region, with noteworthy milestones like the total freeze on funding under the Trump Administration. In this instance, the Trump Administration issued a freeze as retribution for these three countries “failing,” in his words, to stem the flow of migration to the United States and Mexico.</p>

			<p> Funding to the region increased significantly from 2002-2016, reaching an all-time high in 2016 at $2.02 billion. Then under the Trump Administration, this funding fell dramatically, reaching $1.04 billion in 2019. Now, as the Biden Administration looks to address the “push” factors of migration to the U.S., funding is again on the rise, and this will likely continue. It is worth noting that “current” funding is the number used, referencing active funding to the region (rather than future/potential funding). This can explain potential delays in funding freezes and/or cuts from showing up, as typically this takes some time to implement. </p>

		<h3>Key takeaway #2: Five agencies get the most funding </h3>

		<div class="chart">

				<p> The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) consistently receives the most foreign assistance funding for the Northern Triangle. This is likely due to a number of factors. 


				<br>

				<br>
				
				The first is that USAID is one of the few government agencies designed to run actual programming. Whereas the State Department drives policy and has some programming, USAID exclusively runs programming and specifically in the aid and assistnace space. 

				<br>

				<br>

				The government's objectives are also key. Whereas military objectives play a key role in other countries that receive large amounts of U.S. foreign assistance, like Afghanistan and Iraq, the Northern Triangle represents a security objective (stemming migration) but not an explicit military objective. 


				<br>

				<br>

				USAID is able to provide programming in areas like economic development, education, democracy, and more. 

				<br>

				<br>

				By creating more opportunities in-country, USAID can theoretically address some of the "push" factors that impact migration, like lack of opportunities, economic stagnation, and more.

				<br>

				<br>
			
				The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which was founded in 2004, is second in terms of agencies that receive the most U.S. foreign assistance funding for this region. The MCC provides conditional economic growth grants to countries as a means of foreign aid. Like USAID, it is designed to support civilian rather than military objectives. 

				<br>

				<br>

				And like USAID, the MCC's emphasis on economic growth is likely why the U.S. government channels funding to achieve its goal of preventing migration from the region.	

				<br>

				<br>

				The Department of Agriculture also has some funding in the region, in the form of agricultural assistance programs. This illustrates that the U.S. Government considers impact on farmers as a "push" factor on migration. 


				<br>

				<br>

				There is evidence that climate change is already impacting farmers in the region, and this is likely to continue and worsen in the coming years.


				<br>

				<br>
				
				While USAID has climate mitigation and agriculture programming, it will be interesting to see if and how this becomes a larger part of the foreign assistance portfolio in the coming years. </p>

				</script>

		<h3> Key takeaway #3: Funding to individual agencies is  highly varied from year to year </h3>

		<script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();		

		</script>


		<p> U.S. foreign assistance funding to the Northern Triangle fluctuates from year to year. And while five agencies consistently receive the bulk of this funding, the fact that funding to specific agencies changes so much is a concern.

		<br>

		<br>

		Consistency in funding is essential for government agencies to plan, and changing or cutting funding from year to year can have negative consequences on long-term, sustainable objectives. If funding is hard to predict or plan for, it can incentivize short-term, top-down programming, rather than the kind of long-term, steady, and locally led programming that would yield the best results.

		<br>

		<br>

		Thus, it is worth noting that the highly politicized nature of funding to the Northern Triangle, with the stated goal of stemming migration, is likely having a negative impact on actually achieving these objectives.
